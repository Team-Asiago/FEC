<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage and Intention

The old client is an outdated client-facing retail web-portal that has become significantly outdated and has been proven to be hurting sales numbers. Project Catwalk comprises a complete redesign of the retail portal designed to address this concern and modernize the site. The intention of the initial release is to build out a product page with a product overview, ratings & reviews, and Q&A modules. This will be used to display individual products as customers select them.
